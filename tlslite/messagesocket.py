    """TLS Record Layer socket that provides Message level abstraction

    Because the record layer has a hard size limit on sent messages, they need
    to be fragmented before sending. Similarly, a single record layer record
    can include multiple handshake protocol messages (very common with
    ServerHello, Certificate and ServerHelloDone), as such, the user of
    RecordLayer needs to fragment those records into multiple messages.
    Unfortunately, fragmentation of messages requires some degree of
    knowledge about the messages passed and as such is outside scope of pure
    record layer implementation.

    This class tries to provide a useful abstraction for handling Handshake
    protocol messages.

    :vartype recordSize: int
    :ivar recordSize: maximum size of records sent through socket. Messages
        bigger than this size will be fragmented to smaller chunks. Setting it
        to higher value than the default 2^14 will make the implementation
        non RFC compliant and likely not interoperable with other peers.
